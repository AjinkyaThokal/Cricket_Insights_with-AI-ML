# Cricket Insights: The Art of Prediction with AI and Machine Learning

Welcome to **Cricket Insights**, a project that combines the excitement of cricket with the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). This project explores how advanced algorithms can predict key aspects of cricket matches, such as whether a wicket will fall on a particular delivery and the total number of runs scored in a match.

Whether you're a cricket enthusiast, a data science lover, or just curious about how AI can be applied to sports, this project is for you!

## Key Findings

### Random Forest Classifier
- Achieved an accuracy of **87.5%** in predicting total runs.
- Performed exceptionally well in high-scoring categories (251-300, 301-350 and 351-400 runs).
- Struggled slightly with low-frequency categories like 0-100, 101-150, and 151-200 runs.

### Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
- Achieved an accuracy of **92.97%**, outperforming the Random Forest model.
- Demonstrated strong precision and recall in the most frequent categories.
- Served as a reliable baseline model for comparison.

### Conclusions


Using historical data, this project has shown how to apply sophisticated machine learning algorithms to forecast important features of cricket matches. Using three different models‚Äîa Random Forest Classifier, a Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier, and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)‚Äîwe investigated how well these algorithms predicted the amount of runs scored in a match and the probability that a wicket would fall on a particular delivery.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Random Forest Classifier**: The model demonstrated strong performance in categorizing total runs into several groups. Because of its ensemble structure, the Random Forest was able to manage the intricate relationships between many match-specific characteristics, producing results that were both accurate and well-balanced in terms of performance metrics for all classes.

2. **Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier**: While the Naive Bayes model is simpler and computationally efficient, its assumptions of feature independence resulted in slightly lower performance compared to the Random Forest. However, it still offered valuable insights and a reasonable predictive accuracy, making it a useful baseline model.

3. **Artificial Neural Network**: The ANN demonstrated its superiority in estimating the likelihood of a wicket falling by utilizing its capacity to represent non-linear correlations and interactions between features. The evaluation measures showed a solid mix between precision and recall, and the model's performance improved steadily with training, demonstrating the ANN's efficacy in handling challenging cricket prediction tasks.

**Overall Insights:**

- **Data Quality and Preparation**: All of the models demonstrated the significance of feature engineering, managing class imbalances, and doing extensive data purification. An appropriate preparation of the data greatly improved the predicted accuracy and dependability of the models.
  
- **Model Selection**: Every model contributed distinct advantages. The ANN was effective in identifying complex patterns in the data, the Random Forest was reliable and adaptable, and the Naive Bayes was effective and easy to understand. The type of dataset and the particular needs of the prediction task will determine which model is best.

- **Predictive Capabilities**: When trained and validated appropriately, machine learning models can offer substantial predictive potential and insights for analyzing cricket matches. With the help of these forecasts, teams may make more strategic decisions, which will improve their performance and competitive advantage.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates how machine learning may be applied to sports analytics, specifically in the context of cricket. We can find important trends and create wise forecasts by utilizing historical data and cutting-edge algorithms, which will ultimately advance the rapidly developing field of sports analytics.
